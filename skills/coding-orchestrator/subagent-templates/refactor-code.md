# refactor-code

**Skill:** @mimer-code:refactor-code

**Purpose:** Refactor production code to fix identified issues and verify all tests still pass.

**When to spawn:**
- In REFACTOR phase after identify-code-issues finds issues
- Pass: issues report, how to run tests

**What it returns:** Issues fixed, all tests still pass

**What it does NOT do:** Analyze code (that's identify-code-issues's job), write new features, call other skills
