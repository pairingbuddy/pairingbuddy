# refactor-test

**Skill:** @pairingbuddy:refactor-test

**Purpose:** Refactor test code to fix identified issues and verify all tests still pass.

**When to spawn:**
- In REFACTOR phase after identify-test-issues finds issues
- Pass: issues report, how to run tests

**What it returns:** Issues fixed, all tests still pass

**What it does NOT do:** Analyze code (that's identify-test-issues's job), write new tests, call other skills
