# Create Test Placeholders

## Purpose

Create test files with placeholder tests from scenarios and test cases.

## Definitions

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Scenario** | High-level functionality to test (what to test) | "User can log in" |
| **Test Case** | Specific condition with expected outcome | "Login with valid credentials succeeds" |
| **Test** | Code that executes a test case | `def test_login_valid_credentials():` |

**Relationships:** Scenario (1) → Test Cases (many) → Tests (1+ per test case)

## Input

Reads from `.pairingbuddy/scenarios.json`:

```json
{
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "scenario_id": "string (unique identifier)",
      "description": "string (what this scenario covers)",
      "test_cases": [
        {
          "test_case_id": "string (unique identifier)",
          "description": "string (specific condition to verify)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json`:

```json
{
  "source_directory": "string (where production code lives)",
  "runners": {
    "<runner_id>": {
      "name": "string (human-readable name)",
      "command": "string (full invocation including wrapper and runner)",
      "test_directory": "string (where these tests live)",
      "file_pattern": "string (glob pattern for test files)",
      "run_args": ["array of strings appended after test path"]
    }
  },
  "default_runner": "string (runner ID to use when not specified)"
}
```

**Optional:** `.pairingbuddy/coverage-report.json` - if present, only create placeholders for test_cases listed in the `gaps` array:

```json
{
  "status": "complete | incomplete | error",
  "scenarios_covered": "integer (number of scenarios with tests)",
  "scenarios_total": "integer (total number of scenarios)",
  "test_cases_covered": "integer (number of test cases with tests)",
  "test_cases_total": "integer (total number of test cases)",
  "gaps": [
    {
      "scenario_id": "string (scenario with missing coverage)",
      "test_case_id": "string (specific test case missing, optional)",
      "description": "string (what coverage is missing)"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Optional:** `.pairingbuddy/tests.json` (if exists) to check for existing test entries:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "test_id": "string (unique identifier for this test)",
      "test_case_id": "string (back-reference to test case)",
      "scenario_id": "string (back-reference to scenario)",
      "runner_id": "string (which runner from test-config)",
      "test_file": "string (path to test file)",
      "test_function": "string (test function name)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` (if exists):

```json
{
  "guidance": [
    {
      "agent": "string (agent that received this feedback)",
      "timestamp": "string (ISO 8601 datetime)",
      "context": "string (what was being reviewed)",
      "feedback": "string (human's guidance or correction)",
      "persistent": "boolean (optional - if true, carried over from previous session)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply any guidance from prior agents to avoid repeating mistakes or assumptions.

## Instructions

**CRITICAL: Stay laser-focused. Do ONLY what is described below - nothing more. Do not anticipate next steps or do work that belongs to other agents.**

### Step 1: Read Inputs

Read all input files listed above, including `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json`.
Apply any guidance from prior agents to avoid repeating mistakes or assumptions.

### Step 2: Main Work

1. Read scenarios from `.pairingbuddy/scenarios.json`
2. Read test configuration from `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json`
3. Read existing tests from `.pairingbuddy/tests.json` (if exists)
4. **If `.pairingbuddy/coverage-report.json` exists with gaps:**
   - Only process test_cases listed in the gaps array
5. **Otherwise (first pass):**
   - Process all test_cases from scenarios.json
6. Plan placeholder tests for each test_case to process

### Step 3: Human Review

Present your analysis to the human operator for review using AskUserQuestion.

**Review loop:**
1. Present findings and ask for approval
2. If human provides corrections or feedback:
   a. **IMMEDIATELY** append to `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` (before anything else)
   b. Go back and redo your main work (step 2 of Instructions) taking this feedback into account
   c. Present revised analysis and ask again (return to step 1 of this loop)
3. Only exit the loop when human either:
   - Explicitly approves (e.g., "yes", "proceed", "looks good")
   - Explicitly terminates (e.g., "stop", "skip", "cancel")

**Do NOT proceed to output after receiving feedback** - always redo analysis and ask again.

When appending to human-guidance.json:
- Read existing file first (or create with `{"guidance": []}` if missing)
- Append a new entry capturing the essence of the feedback
- Write the updated file

Example guidance entry:
```json
{
  "agent": "enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-15T10:30:00Z",
  "context": "reviewing proposed scenarios",
  "feedback": "Focus on core functionality, edge cases are out of scope"
}
```

Only append when the human provides corrections or guidance. Simple approvals ("looks good", "proceed") do not need to be recorded.

Example interaction:

```
AskUserQuestion: "I've identified the following items for processing:
- Item 1: [description]
- Item 2: [description]

Should I proceed with this approach?"
```

### Step 4: Output

After approval, for each test_case to process:
- Skip if tests.json already has an entry for this test_case_id (idempotent)
- Create placeholder test in the configured test directory
- Generate unique test_id
- Append entry to tests.json

### File Creation Restrictions

**You may ONLY write to:**
- `.pairingbuddy/tests.json` (your JSON output)
- Test files within the `test_directory` specified in `test-config.json`

Do NOT create files anywhere else. No /tmp files, no markdown files, no files outside the test directory.

## Output

Writes to `.pairingbuddy/tests.json`:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "test_id": "string (unique identifier for this test)",
      "test_case_id": "string (back-reference to test case)",
      "scenario_id": "string (back-reference to scenario)",
      "runner_id": "string (which runner from test-config)",
      "test_file": "string (path to test file)",
      "test_function": "string (test function name)"
    }
  ]
}
```
