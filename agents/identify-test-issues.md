# Identify Test Issues

## Purpose

Analyze test code and identify quality issues that should be addressed during the REFACTOR phase.

## Definitions

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Scenario** | High-level functionality to test (what to test) | "User can log in" |
| **Test Case** | Specific condition with expected outcome | "Login with valid credentials succeeds" |
| **Test** | Code that executes a test case | `def test_login_valid_credentials():` |

**Relationships:** Scenario (1) → Test Cases (many) → Tests (1+ per test case)

## Input

Reads from `.pairingbuddy/tests.json`:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "test_id": "string (unique identifier for this test)",
      "test_case_id": "string (back-reference to test case)",
      "scenario_id": "string (back-reference to scenario)",
      "runner_id": "string (which runner from test-config)",
      "test_file": "string (path to test file)",
      "test_function": "string (test function name)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json`:

```json
{
  "source_directory": "string (where production code lives)",
  "runners": {
    "<runner_id>": {
      "name": "string (human-readable name)",
      "command": "string (full invocation including wrapper and runner)",
      "test_directory": "string (where these tests live)",
      "file_pattern": "string (glob pattern for test files)",
      "run_args": ["array of strings appended after test path"]
    }
  },
  "default_runner": "string (runner ID to use when not specified)"
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` (if exists):

```json
{
  "guidance": [
    {
      "agent": "string (agent that received this feedback)",
      "timestamp": "string (ISO 8601 datetime)",
      "context": "string (what was being reviewed)",
      "feedback": "string (human's guidance or correction)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply any guidance from prior agents to avoid repeating mistakes or assumptions.

## Instructions

1. Read test mapping from `.pairingbuddy/tests.json`
2. Read test configuration from `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json`
3. For each test file referenced:
   a. Read the test code
   b. Identify quality issues
   c. Record each issue with file, line, type, description
4. [Present identified issues to human for review](#human-review)
5. After approval, write issues to `.pairingbuddy/test-issues.json`

### File Creation Restrictions

**You may ONLY write to:** `.pairingbuddy/test-issues.json`

Do NOT create any other files. No /tmp files, no markdown files, no text files. Your sole output is the JSON file specified in the Output section.

**Do NOT:**
- Fix issues (that's for refactor-tests agent)
- Report issues in production code (that's for identify-code-issues)
- Report missing test scenarios (that's for identify-coverage-gaps)

## Human Review

Before proceeding with implementation, pause and present your analysis to the human operator for review.

- Use the AskUserQuestion tool to present your findings
- Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
- If the human operator requests changes:
  1. Revise your analysis accordingly
  2. Append their feedback to `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json`
  3. Ask again with the revised analysis

When appending to human-guidance.json:
- Read existing file first (or create with `{"guidance": []}` if missing)
- Append a new entry capturing the essence of the feedback
- Write the updated file

Example guidance entry:
```json
{
  "agent": "enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-15T10:30:00Z",
  "context": "reviewing proposed scenarios",
  "feedback": "Focus on core functionality, edge cases are out of scope"
}
```

Only append when the human provides corrections or guidance. Simple approvals ("looks good", "proceed") do not need to be recorded.

Example interaction:

```
AskUserQuestion: "I've identified the following items for processing:
- Item 1: [description]
- Item 2: [description]

Should I proceed with this approach?"
```

## Output

Writes to `.pairingbuddy/test-issues.json`:

```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "file": "string (file path where issue was found)",
      "line": "integer (line number, optional)",
      "issue_type": "string (category of issue)",
      "description": "string (what the issue is)",
      "suggestion": "string (how to fix it, optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```
