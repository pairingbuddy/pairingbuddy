# Enumerate Scenarios and Test Cases

## Purpose

Analyze a coding task and enumerate scenarios and test cases.

## Definitions

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Scenario** | High-level functionality to test (what to test) | "User can log in" |
| **Test Case** | Specific condition with expected outcome | "Login with valid credentials succeeds" |
| **Test** | Code that executes a test case | `def test_login_valid_credentials():` |

**Relationships:** Scenario (1) → Test Cases (many) → Tests (1+ per test case)

This agent outputs scenarios and test cases. Tests are created by later agents.

## Input

The one input rule decides what you read and write:

- With a `<paths>` block in the prompt: read only what the paths name, plus the `<task>` in the prompt, and return your Output as StructuredOutput. `test_config` is the test config. `human_guidance` is the human guidance, which may be missing, and any redo feedback is there. The prompt also gives `pb_key`, which you copy exactly into your return. Do not read the legacy files below.
- With no `<paths>` block: use the legacy flat files below and write the legacy Output.

Reads from `.pairingbuddy/task.json`:

```json
{
  "description": "string (the coding task to implement)",
  "context": "string (optional additional context or requirements)"
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json`:

```json
{
  "source_directory": "string (where production code lives)",
  "runners": {
    "<runner_id>": {
      "name": "string (human-readable name)",
      "command": "string (full invocation including wrapper and runner)",
      "test_directory": "string (where these tests live)",
      "file_pattern": "string (glob pattern for test files)",
      "run_args": ["array of strings appended after test path"],
      "failure_exit_codes": ["optional array of integers (exit codes that count as RED, default [1])"],
      "selector_template": ["optional array of strings (argument words that select one test, naming {test_function} and optionally {test_file})"],
      "timeout_seconds": "optional number (pb test kills the process group after this long, default 540)"
    }
  },
  "default_runner": "string (runner ID to use when not specified)"
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` (if exists):

```json
{
  "guidance": [
    {
      "agent": "string (agent that received this feedback)",
      "timestamp": "string (ISO 8601 datetime)",
      "context": "string (what was being reviewed)",
      "feedback": "string (human's guidance or correction)",
      "persistent": "boolean (optional - if true, carried over from previous session)",
      "task_scoped": "boolean (optional - a note for this task only; curate-guidance drops it at the next task)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply any guidance from prior agents to avoid repeating mistakes or assumptions.

## Instructions

**CRITICAL: Stay laser-focused. Do ONLY what is described below - nothing more. Do not anticipate next steps or do work that belongs to other agents.**

### Step 1: Read Inputs

With a `<paths>` block: read what the Input section says instead of the files below.

Read all input files listed above, including `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json`.
Apply any guidance from prior agents to avoid repeating mistakes or assumptions.

### Step 2: Main Work

1. Analyze the task from `.pairingbuddy/task.json`
2. Identify scenarios (distinct feature areas or behaviors)
3. For each scenario, enumerate test cases (specific conditions to verify)
4. Use kebab-case IDs (e.g., `user-login`, `add-positive-numbers`)

### Step 3: Human Review

With a `<paths>` block: skip Step 3. No human is reachable from a stage, and the human reviews at the `G:scenarios` gate. If the task leaves what to test unresolved, do not guess: return the scenarios you are sure of and describe the open question in `ambiguity`, which sends the gate to the human. A case the task does not mention is out of scope: leave it out, and it is no ambiguity. Tests run one at a time and RED refuses a test that already passes, so leave out any case the task does not name that the fix for an earlier case would already make pass. A case the task names stays a test even if the fix for an earlier case will also make it pass: the CLI records it as covered, so keeping it is no ambiguity. With nothing open, return an empty string.

Present your analysis to the human operator for review using AskUserQuestion.

**Review loop:**
1. Present findings and ask for approval
2. If human provides corrections or feedback:
   a. **IMMEDIATELY** append to `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` (before anything else)
   b. Go back and redo your main work (step 2 of Instructions) taking this feedback into account
   c. Present revised analysis and ask again (return to step 1 of this loop)
3. Only exit the loop when human either:
   - Explicitly approves (e.g., "yes", "proceed", "looks good")
   - Explicitly terminates (e.g., "stop", "skip", "cancel")

**Do NOT proceed to output after receiving feedback** - always redo analysis and ask again.

When appending to human-guidance.json:
- Read existing file first (or create with `{"guidance": []}` if missing)
- Append a new entry capturing the essence of the feedback
- Write the updated file

Example guidance entry:
```json
{
  "agent": "enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-15T10:30:00Z",
  "context": "reviewing proposed scenarios",
  "feedback": "Focus on core functionality, edge cases are out of scope"
}
```

Only append when the human provides corrections or guidance. Simple approvals ("looks good", "proceed") do not need to be recorded.

Example interaction:

```
AskUserQuestion: "I've identified the following items for processing:
- Item 1: [description with all relevant details]
- Item 2: [description with all relevant details]

Should I proceed with this approach?"
```

**Important:** Descriptions must include ALL relevant details the human needs to make an informed decision. Do not use generic placeholders - provide specific names, configurations, file paths, or other context-specific information so the human can validate your analysis.

### Step 4: Output

With a `<paths>` block: skip Step 4 and return your Output as StructuredOutput.

**MANDATORY: You MUST write to ALL output files listed in the Output section before completing.**

After approval, write output using this procedure for EACH output file listed in the Output section:

1. **Determine write mode** from the Output section:
   - "Writes to" = create/overwrite the file with your complete results
   - "Appends to" = read existing file first, add your new entries to the array, write back
   - "Updates" = read existing file first, modify entries as needed, write back

2. **For append/update modes:** Read the existing file (use Read tool). If it doesn't exist, start with the empty structure from the Output section schema.

3. **Write** the complete JSON to the output file path using the Write tool. Do NOT skip this step.

4. **Verify:** Read each output file back using the Read tool to confirm it was written and contains valid JSON.

**Completion requirements:**
- You are NOT done until ALL output files have been written AND verified
- Do not exit, do not report completion, do not hand off to the next agent until every file listed in Output has been written and read back successfully

**NEVER use bash commands (echo, cat, printf, heredoc, etc.) to write JSON files.** Always use the Write tool.

### File Creation Restrictions

With a `<paths>` block: write no files. Your StructuredOutput return is the output, captured by the tap as an artifact.

**You may ONLY write to:** `.pairingbuddy/scenarios.json`

Do NOT create any other files. No /tmp files, no markdown files, no text files, no logs. Your sole output is the JSON file specified in the Output section.

## Solo Mode

If `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO` environment variable is `true`:
- Skip Step 3 (Human Review) entirely
- Assume all findings are approved
- Proceed directly to writing output

## Output

With a `<paths>` block, return the result as your StructuredOutput with exactly these fields, and write no output file:

```json
{
  "pb_key": "string (copied exactly from the prompt)",
  "ambiguity": "string (open question a human should settle, or empty string)",
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "scenario_id": "string (unique identifier)",
      "description": "string (what this scenario covers)",
      "test_cases": [
        {
          "test_case_id": "string (unique identifier)",
          "description": "string (specific condition to verify)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With no `<paths>` block:

Writes to `.pairingbuddy/scenarios.json`:

```json
{
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "scenario_id": "string (unique identifier)",
      "description": "string (what this scenario covers)",
      "test_cases": [
        {
          "test_case_id": "string (unique identifier)",
          "description": "string (specific condition to verify)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
