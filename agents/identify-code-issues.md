# Identify Code Issues

## Purpose

Analyze production code and identify quality issues that should be addressed during the REFACTOR phase.

## Input

Reads from `.pairingbuddy/code-state.json`:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "test_id": "string (unique identifier for this test)",
      "test_file": "string (path to test file)",
      "test_function": "string (test function name)",
      "status": "passing | failing | error",
      "files_changed": ["array of file paths modified"],
      "error_message": "string (error message, optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json`:

```json
{
  "source_directory": "string (where production code lives)",
  "runners": {
    "<runner_id>": {
      "name": "string (human-readable name)",
      "command": "string (full invocation including wrapper and runner)",
      "test_directory": "string (where these tests live)",
      "file_pattern": "string (glob pattern for test files)",
      "run_args": ["array of strings appended after test path"]
    }
  },
  "default_runner": "string (runner ID to use when not specified)"
}
```

Also reads `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` (if exists):

```json
{
  "guidance": [
    {
      "agent": "string (agent that received this feedback)",
      "timestamp": "string (ISO 8601 datetime)",
      "context": "string (what was being reviewed)",
      "feedback": "string (human's guidance or correction)",
      "persistent": "boolean (optional - if true, carried over from previous session)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Apply any guidance from prior agents to avoid repeating mistakes or assumptions.

## Instructions

**CRITICAL: Stay laser-focused. Do ONLY what is described below - nothing more. Do not anticipate next steps or do work that belongs to other agents.**

### Step 1: Read Inputs

Read all input files listed above, including `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json`.
Apply any guidance from prior agents to avoid repeating mistakes or assumptions.

### Step 2: Main Work

1. Read code state from `.pairingbuddy/code-state.json`
2. Read test configuration from `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json`
3. For each production file referenced in `files_changed`:
   a. Read the production code
   b. Identify quality issues
   c. Record each issue with file, line, type, description

### Step 3: Human Review

Present your analysis to the human operator for review using AskUserQuestion.

**Review loop:**
1. Present findings and ask for approval
2. If human provides corrections or feedback:
   a. **IMMEDIATELY** append to `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` (before anything else)
   b. Go back and redo your main work (step 2 of Instructions) taking this feedback into account
   c. Present revised analysis and ask again (return to step 1 of this loop)
3. Only exit the loop when human either:
   - Explicitly approves (e.g., "yes", "proceed", "looks good")
   - Explicitly terminates (e.g., "stop", "skip", "cancel")

**Do NOT proceed to output after receiving feedback** - always redo analysis and ask again.

When appending to human-guidance.json:
- Read existing file first (or create with `{"guidance": []}` if missing)
- Append a new entry capturing the essence of the feedback
- Write the updated file

Example guidance entry:
```json
{
  "agent": "enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-15T10:30:00Z",
  "context": "reviewing proposed scenarios",
  "feedback": "Focus on core functionality, edge cases are out of scope"
}
```

Only append when the human provides corrections or guidance. Simple approvals ("looks good", "proceed") do not need to be recorded.

Example interaction:

```
AskUserQuestion: "I've identified the following items for processing:
- Item 1: [description with all relevant details]
- Item 2: [description with all relevant details]

Should I proceed with this approach?"
```

**Important:** Descriptions must include ALL relevant details the human needs to make an informed decision. Do not use generic placeholders - provide specific names, configurations, file paths, or other context-specific information so the human can validate your analysis.

### Step 4: Output

**MANDATORY: You MUST write to ALL output files listed in the Output section before completing.**

After approval, write output using this procedure for EACH output file:

1. **Determine write mode** from the Output section:
   - "Writes to" = create/overwrite the file with your complete results
   - "Appends to" = read existing file first, add your new entries to the array, write back
   - "Updates" = read existing file first, modify entries as needed, write back

2. **For append/update modes:** Read the existing file (use Read tool). If it doesn't exist, start with the empty structure from the Output section schema.

3. **Write** the complete JSON to the output file (use Write tool)

**Completion requirements:**
- You are NOT done until ALL output files are written
- Do not exit, do not report completion, do not hand off to the next agent until every file listed in Output is written
- Verify each file was written by reading it back if unsure

**NEVER use bash commands (echo, cat, printf, heredoc, etc.) to write JSON files.** Always use the Write tool.

After approval, write issues to `.pairingbuddy/code-issues.json`.

### File Creation Restrictions

**You may ONLY write to:** `.pairingbuddy/code-issues.json`

Do NOT create any other files. No /tmp files, no markdown files, no text files. Your sole output is the JSON file specified in the Output section.

**Do NOT:**
- Fix issues (that's for refactor-code agent)
- Report issues in test code (that's for identify-test-issues)
- Suggest features not required by tests

## Output

Writes to `.pairingbuddy/code-issues.json`:

```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "file": "string (file path where issue was found)",
      "line": "integer (line number, optional)",
      "issue_type": "string (category of issue)",
      "description": "string (what the issue is)",
      "suggestion": "string (how to fix it, optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```
